# Starter
This is a starter project to use as a foundation for future projects, containing basic components and being easily customisable.

This project has been built using Vite, React, HTML and CSS.

The author prefers CSS over SCSS, as does not find nesting easier to read, especially in very large files. Apart from nesting, the author sees no real advantage in using SCSS, since CSS now supports variables (custom properties) and does not require compilation, which is a significant benefit. While CSS lacks mixins, the author does not consider using multiple classes instead of mixins a major drawback.
